# playlist-generation
Playlist generation tool for .hdf5 song files. When input a song and an accompanying library, (both in .hdf5 format), this application measures similarity generically to produce a new playlist.

Developed as a final project for Dr. Phillips' CS 5140 Data Mining course at the University of Utah in Spring 2019.
My partner and I, @cindyliao1, developed this in the span of two months. Showcasing the use of such data mining topics as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means++ clustering.
Million Song dataset was used for training data. --> http://millionsongdataset.com/
